Created this game with 2 other developers in Java. It requires a server to run. It is a one player game,
and the objective is to sink all other ships on the playing field.

Controls:

Arrow Keys - Move
Space Bar - Fire

How to Download:

Download ClientShipGame.jar and run.
Make sure you have an updated version of Java in case it does not run.
Might have to recompile source code using ANT, or any other jar creator if not working.
Otherwise, open in an IDE such as Eclipse or Netbeans.
